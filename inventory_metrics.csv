M056,Vulnerability Metrics,Interface-Induced Vulnerabilities ,,"The interface to access software from the outside world (i.e., service access points) offers potential opportunities to launch cyberattacks against the software. The attack surface metric [Manadhata and Wing 2011] aims to measure the ways in which an attacker can compromise targeted software. This metric is designed because many attacks against software can be conducted by ingesting data from the environment (where the software runs) into the software (e.g., buffer overrun) or by receiving data through interactions with the software. These attacks typically interact with software by connecting to a channel (e.g., sockets) or invoking a method (e.g., Application Programming Interface) offered by the software, or by sending/receiving data to/from the software.
